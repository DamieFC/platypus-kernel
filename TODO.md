# To do
1. Add CPU support. Currently, this supports `ARM64`, `x86`(`\_64`), `RISCV` and `openRISC`. I do want `PowerPC`.
2. Add drivers. I added a ton of drivers, but I still need aux audio.
3. Add a bootloader. It doesn't boot! There's no power! NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! THIS THING IS USELESS!!!!
4. Add a GUI. Nobody in the 21st century wants an OS without an easy to use GUI with clicky buttons with fun fonts and colors! This isn't PC-/MS-DOS and Windows 1.01 days! *Note, I am working on uploading the Xorg server*
5. Add pentesting tools. Pentesting tools are important, because this OS is going to be used for programming, web development, and pentesting.
6. Add more fun games! I just found xbill and I'm practically addicted, I want to add it.

Seeing as I've got all this stuff, I do need your help. A lot.
