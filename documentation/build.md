# Building
## NOTE: I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS WILL WORK. IF YOU ATTEMPT TO BUILD AND IT CRASHES AND TURNS YOUR COMPUTER INTO A TOASTER, THAT'S NOT MY FAULT. AND DO ***NOT*** INSTALL ON YOUR COMPUTER THAT WILL ALMOST DEFINITELY TURN YOUR COMPUTER INTO A TOASTER.
Ok, with that out of the way, here's what I think you would do to make an image:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Platypus-Tech/platypus-os-desktop-pre-alpha.git
cd platypus-os-desktop-pre-alpha
make
make image
```
I think that's how you would make an image to run in QEMU or something. Really, I don't know. I haven't tried, mainly because I'm scared that the mile long list of errors would give me a `not enough memory, you moron. Did you seriously think that this would work???` error.
