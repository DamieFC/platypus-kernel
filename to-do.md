# To do
1. Add CPU support. Currently, there is no CPU stuff, I want it to support PowerPC, x86, x86-64, amd, amd64, arm, arm64 and RISCV, but mainly x86/x86-64, amd/amd64, arm/arm64, and RISCV, seeing as nobody uses PowerPC (The 64-bit is prefered, due to 2038 slowly approaching).
2. Add drivers. Without drivers, you can't really do anything, like plug in a USB stick, a printer, a mouse, a keyboard, headphones, etc. I have them in a Google Drive folder, but you can't upload folders, sadly. (Plus, 100 file limit.)
3. Add a booting thing. It doesn't boot! There's no power! NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! THIS THING IS USELESS!!!!
4. Add a GUI. Nobody in the 21st century wants an OS without an easy to use GUI with clicky buttons with fun fonts and colors! This isn't PC-/MS-DOS and Windows 1.01 days!
5. Add pentesting tools. Pentesting tools are important, because this OS is going to be used for programming, web development, and pentesting.
6. Add more fun games! I just found xbill and I'm practically addicted, I want to add it.
