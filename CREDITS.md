# CREDITS
Well, if you read the README.md file (it literally says ***READ ME***! :smiley:), you saw that it said some files came from the Linux kernel! Well, they did. Beneath I will put all credits to other files.
## DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT
Right now I have xfce, GNOME, KDE Plasma, and X-windows.
## CLIS
BASH Shell, by GNU project
<br>
CROSH, by I think Google or the Chromium project, cannot seem to find who :(
<br>
Brigadier, by Mojang
<br>
Python Shell (IDLE) by the Python Software foundation
## OTHER SYSTEM STUFF
Linux kernel, by Linus Torvalds and lots and lots of other people :)
