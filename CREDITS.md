# CREDITS
Well, if you read the README.md file (it literally says ***READ ME***! :smiley:), you saw that it said some files came from the Linux kernel! Well, they did. Beneath I will put all credits to other files.
## DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT
I quit GNOME for now.
## COMMAND LINE INTERFACES
I quit BASH for now.
## OTHER SYSTEM STUFF
Linux kernel, by Linus Torvalds and lots and lots of other people :)
