# To do
1. Add CPU support. Currently, there is no CPU stuff, I want it to support PowerPC, x86, x86-64, amd, amd64, arm, and arm64.
2. Add drivers. Without drivers, you can't really do anything, like plug in a USB stick, a printer, a mouse, a keyboard, headphones, etc. I have them in a Google Drive folder, but you can't upload folders, sadly.
3. Add a booting thing. It doesn't boot! There's no power! NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
4. Add a GUI. Nobody in the 21st century wants an OS without an easy to use GUI with clicky buttons with fun fonts!
5. Add pentesting tools. Pentesting tools are important, because this OS is going to be used for programming, web development, and pentesting.
