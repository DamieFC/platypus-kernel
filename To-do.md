# To do
1. Add CPU support. Currently, there is no CPU stuff, I want it to support PowerPC, x86, x86-64, amd, amd64, arm, and arm64.
2. Add drivers. Without drivers, you can't really do anything, like plug in a USB stick, a printer, a mouse, a keyboard, headphones, etc. I have them in a Google Drive folder, but you can't upload folders, sadly.
