# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Overview

Just be nice to each other. Don't use degrading, rude, nasty, vulgar, etc, language with others. This is a place to share and review code, not a place to pick fights and start flamewars. In other words, *Treat others the way you would like to be treated*. It's something we learned in Kindergarten, but it works for just about everything. Spam humor is accepted, and maaay be implemented as an Easter Egg.
