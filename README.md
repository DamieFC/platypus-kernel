<!--# Platypus OS Desktop
The desktop for Platypus OS. Because Platypus OS is a totally new thing (Ok, maybe not totally, there are some, actually, a lot of files from the Linux kernel), it has an (almost) totally new kernel, and this is the desktop OS. This is where it all goes. NOTE, ***THIS IS IN PRE ALPHA STAGE WHICH ISN'T EVEN A THING. IF YOU INSTALL IT, AND WHEN IT CRASHES, IT'S NOT MY FAULT. THANK YOU GNU PROJECT FOR PUTTING THAT IN YOUR LICENSE. THAT'S WHY I DON'T HAVE INSTRUCTIONS ON INSTALLING.*** See the file "version.txt" for what version you have. (What? All the GNU projects have it, except it's `version.h`.)
## What this is
Platypus OS is an in-development OS for the following:
* Pentesting
* Programming
* Playing video games

<!--It's a weird combination, but that's what I like to do: pentest, program, and play video games.
## How to get around/Navigation

## Support for things
Currently, I cannot run this code, so I don't know what support it has. So, I'll put what I think it supports. *If there is support for something, please let me know by editing this and making a pull request. I'll look over it and probably merge it, or work with you on it. I'm pretty active here so I'll get to you within a reasonable amount of time, never more than a day, unless it's the weekend. Then it might take until Monday.*
### Filesystems
1. UFS
2. FAT
3. EXT4
4. HPFS
### Internet
I believe there is support for internet stuff.
### CPU
I think it has support for ARM64 and now x86.

## Contributing
See [contributing.md](contributing.md) for guidelines.
## This used to be the kernel! What happened?
This was the kernel, then I decided I would make this the desktop, and then the kernel repository would come along later, once this was fully developed.
## This has a lot of GNU. When this is deployed, will it just be called "Platypus OS" or "GNU/Platypus OS"?
GNU/Platypus OS to avoid all the arguments around GNU/Linux. -->
# Notice
I may be ceasing development of Platypus OS. I realize that I messed up. Thank you to [@berg95](https://github.com/berg95) for contributing to the CLI, and thank you to [@TIBTHINK](https://github.com/TIBTHINK) for offering to help with the project. Still, if you want to contribute, contribute! I'll still merge stuff and pay attention to your issues.
