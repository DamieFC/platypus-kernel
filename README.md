# Platypus Kernel
The basic kernel for Platypus OS. Because Platypus OS is a totally new thing (Ok, maybe not totally, there are some files from the Linux kernel), it has an (almost) totally new kernel. This is where it all goes.
## How to get around
I reealized that I have nothing here about how to get around. So, here we go:
***
### The `.github` folder
That's my code scanning thing
### The `command lines` folder
That is where everything relating to the command lines goes
#### The `platypusPrompt `folder
That is where the command line for logging in, and other stuff goes, it is in another repository.
### `The Desktop tools` folder
This is where the desktop environment goes, if I could only upload a folder.
### The `security` folder
This is really important. That is where everything security related goes.
